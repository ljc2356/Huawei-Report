 abstract={The message-passing approach to model-based signal processing is developed with a focus on Gaussian message passing in linear state-space models, which includes recursive least squares, linear minimum-mean-squared-error estimation, and Kalman filtering algorithms. Tabulated message computation rules for the building blocks of linear models allow us to compose a variety of such algorithms without additional derivations or computations. Beyond the Gaussian case, it is emphasized that the message-passing approach encourages us to mix and match different algorithmic techniques, which is exemplified by two different approaches - steepest descent and expectation maximization - to message passing through a multiplier node.},

 abstract={Efficient implementations of the sum-product algorithm (SPA) are presented for decoding low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes using log-likelihood ratios (LLR) as messages between symbol and parity-check nodes. Various reduced-complexity derivatives of the LLR-SPA are proposed. Both serial and parallel implementations are investigated, leading to trellis and tree topologies, respectively. Furthermore, by exploiting the inherent robustness of LLRs, it is shown, via simulations, that coarse quantization tables are sufficient to implement complex core operations with negligible or no loss in performance. The unified treatment of decoding techniques for LDPC codes presented here provides flexibility in selecting the appropriate design point in high-speed applications from a performance, latency and computational complexity perspective},

  year={1990},
 abstract={ABSTRACT  Introduction For nearly a century, statisticians have been intrigued by the problems of developing a satisfactory methodology for the analysis of spatial data; see Student (1914), for an early example. It is only since the early 1970's, however, that the statistical analysis of large data sets, using flexible parametric models has become a feasible proposition. On the practical side, progress has been made possible by the availability of relatively cheap, computerised resources for the collection and analysis of data. The study of digital images and the use of satellite data for remote sensing are prominent examples in this respect. On the methodological side, substantial progress is associated with the introduction of Markov random fields (MRFs), as a class of parametric models for spatial data (Besag 1974). Shaped by these developments, spatial statistics has emerged as perhaps the most dynamic and computer intensive of all the areas of statistical endeavour; building upon models u},

  title={Extending Factor Graphs so as to Unify Directed and Undirected Graphical Models},
  author={Frey, Brendan J.},
  year={2012},
 keywords={Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence},
 abstract={The two most popular types of graphical model are directed models (Bayesian networks) and undirected models (Markov random fields, or MRFs). Directed and undirected models offer complementary properties in model construction, expressing conditional independencies, expressing arbitrary factorizations of joint distributions, and formulating message-passing inference algorithms. We show that the strengths of these two representations can be combined in a single type of graphical model called a 'factor graph'. Every Bayesian network or MRF can be easily converted to a factor graph that expresses the same conditional independencies, expresses the same factorization of the joint distribution, and can be used for probabilistic inference through application of a single, simple message-passing algorithm. In contrast to chain graphs, where message-passing is implemented on a hypergraph, message-passing can be directly implemented on the factor graph. We describe a modified 'Bayes-ball' algorithm for establishing conditional independence in factor graphs, and we show that factor graphs form a strict superset of Bayesian networks and MRFs. In particular, we give an example of a commonly-used 'mixture of experts' model fragment, whose independencies cannot be represented in a Bayesian network or an MRF, but can be represented in a factor graph. We finish by giving examples of real-world problems that are not well suited to representation in Bayesian networks and MRFs, but are well-suited to representation in factor graphs.},

  title={Iterative receiver design},
  author={HenkWymeersch},
  publisher={Cambridge University Press},
  year={2007},
 abstract={Iterative processing is an important technique with numerous applications. Exploiting the power of factor graphs, this detailed survey provides a general framework for systematically developing iterative algorithms for digital receivers, and highlights connections between important algorithms. Starting with basic concepts in digital communications, progressively more complex ideas are presented and integrated resulting in the development of cutting-edge algorithms for iterative receivers. Real-world applications are covered in detail, including decoding for turbo and LDPC codes, and detection for multi-antenna and multi-user systems. This accessible framework will allow the reader to apply factor graphs to practical problems, leading to the design of new algorithms in applications beyond digital receivers. With many examples and algorithms in pseudo-code, this book is an invaluable resource for graduate students and researchers in electrical engineering and computer science, and for practitioners in the communications industry.

Graphical models can represent complex real-world systems, and such representations help to derive practical detection/estimation algorithms in a wide area of applications. Most known signal processing techniques -including gradient methods, Kalman filtering, and particle methods -can be used as components of such algorithms. Other than most of the previous literature, we have used Forney-style factor graphs, which support hierarchical modeling and are compatible with standard block diagrams.},

 abstract={Abstract We study the satisfiability of randomly generated formulas formed by M  clauses of exactly K  literals over N  Boolean variables. For a given value of N  the problem is known to be most difficult when ¦Á = M/N  is close to the experimental threshold ¦Á c  separating the region where almost all formulas are SAT from the region where all formulas are UNSAT. Recent results from a statistical physics analysis suggest that the difficulty is related to the existence of a clustering phenomenon of the solutions when ¦Á is close to (but smaller than) ¦Á c . We introduce a new type of message passing algorithm which allows to find efficiently a satisfying assignment of the variables in this difficult region. This algorithm is iterative and composed of two main parts. The first is a message-passing procedure which generalizes the usual methods like Sum-Product or Belief Propagation: It passes messages that may be thought of as surveys over clusters of the ordinary messages. The second part uses the detailed probabilistic information obtained from the surveys in order to fix variables and simplify the problem. Eventually, the simplified problem that remains is solved by a conventional heuristic. ? 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct. Alg., 2005},

 abstract={Summary: We present a new framework based on walks in a graph for analysis and inference in Gaussian graphical models. The key idea is to decompose the correlation between each pair of variables as a sum over all walks between those variables in the graph. The weight of each walk is given by a product of edgewise partial correlation coefficients. This representation holds for a large class of Gaussian graphical models which we call walk-summable. We give a precise characterization of this class of models, and relate it to other classes including diagonally dominant, attractive, non-frustrated, and pairwise-normalizable. We provide a walk-sum interpretation of Gaussian belief propagation in trees and of the approximate method of loopy belief propagation in graphs with cycles. The walk-sum perspective leads to a better understanding of Gaussian belief propagation and to stronger results for its convergence in loopy graphs.},

 abstract={Graphical models, such as Bayesian networks and Markov networks, represent joint distributions over a set of variables by means of a graph. When the graph is singly connected, local propagation rules of the sort proposed by Pearl (1988) are guaranteed to converge to the correct posterior probabilities. Recently a number of researchers have empirically demonstrated good performance of these same local propagation schemes on graphs with loops, but a theoretical understanding of this performance has yet to be achieved. For graphical models with a single loop, we derive an analytical relationship between the probabilities computed using local propagation and the correct marginals. Using this relationship we show a category of graphical models with loops for which local propagation gives rise to provably optimal maximum a posteriori assignments (although the computed marginals will be incorrect). We also show how nodes can use local information in the messages they receive in order to correct their computed marginals. We discuss how these results can be extended to graphical models with multiple loops and show simulation results suggesting that some properties of propagation on single-loop graphs may hold for a larger class of graphs. Specifically we discuss the implication of our results for understanding a class of recently proposed error-correcting codes known as turbo codes.},

 keywords={dual extended Kalman filter methods;dual EKF-prediction error;probabilistic perspective;dual EKF variance estimation},
 abstract={Abstract This paper points out the flaws in using the extended Kalman filter (EKE) and introduces an improvement, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF), proposed by Julier and Uhlman (1997). A central and vital operation performed in the Kalman filter is the propagation of a Gaussian random variable (GRV) through the system dynamics. In the EKF the state distribution is approximated by a GRV, which is then propagated analytically through the first-order linearization of the nonlinear system. This can introduce large errors in the true posterior mean and covariance of the transformed GRV, which may lead to sub-optimal performance and sometimes divergence of the filter. The UKF addresses this problem by using a deterministic sampling approach. The state distribution is again approximated by a GRV, but is now represented using a minimal set of carefully chosen sample points. These sample points completely capture the true mean and covariance of the GRV, and when propagated through the true nonlinear system, captures the posterior mean and covariance accurately to the 3rd order (Taylor series expansion) for any nonlinearity. The EKF in contrast, only achieves first-order accuracy. Remarkably, the computational complexity of the UKF is the same order as that of the EKF. Julier and Uhlman demonstrated the substantial performance gains of the UKF in the context of state-estimation for nonlinear control. Machine learning problems were not considered. We extend the use of the UKF to a broader class of nonlinear estimation problems, including nonlinear system identification, training of neural networks, and dual estimation problems. In this paper, the algorithms are further developed and illustrated with a number of additional examples},
